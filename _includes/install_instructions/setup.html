A few tools included in the VM require the use of a license and so you will need to provide your own at first use. More details are provided in the two next sections.

  A license key must be obtained to make the FreeSurfer tools operational. Obtaining a license is free and comes in the form of a license.txt file.

    <li>*Get one:* if you do not have a Freesurfer license.txt key file yet, you can get one at the following <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html">link</a></li> 
    <li>*Install:*  Once you obtain the license.txt file, download it inside the VM (for instance you can use the shared folder previously configured) and copy it to the FreeSurfer installation directory (i.e. "$HOME/Softwares/freesurfer" defined by the $FREESURFER_HOME environment variable).</li> 
  </ol>
</p>

<h4 id="start_vm">Trackvis license</h4>
<p>
  A license key must be obtained to be able to use Trackvis, a tool for viewing fibers reconstructed with tractography. 
  <ol>
    <li>*Get one:* if you do not have a Trackvis license key yet, you can get one by creating a new account at the <a href="http://www.trackvis.org/download/">download request page</a> of Trackvis website.</li> 
    <li>*Validate:*  Once your account is created and you have received the email with a summary of your Name / Institution / License Key, you can start Trackvis.
