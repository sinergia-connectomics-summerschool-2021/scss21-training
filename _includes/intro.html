  <a href="{{site.scss21_site}}">Brain Dynamics on the Connectome Sinergia Online Summer School 2021</a>
  aims to introduce advanced topics in multimodal brain connectomics.
  The lectures follow the structure of a pipeline to estimate structural connectivity from diffusion MRI data,
  dynamic functional connectivity from M/EEG recordings and integrate them together with computational modeling.
