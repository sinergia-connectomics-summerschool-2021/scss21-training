HEADER

Edit the values in the block above to be appropriate for your workshop.
If the value is not 'true', 'false', 'null', or a number, please use
double quotation marks around the value, unless specified otherwise.
And run 'make workshop-check' *before* committing to make sure that changes are good.

EVENTBRITE

This block includes the Eventbrite registration widget if

SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.
{% endcomment %}

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

    {% include _includes/schedule.html %}

    {% comment %}
    Edit/replace the text above if you want to include a schedule table.
    See the contents of the _includes/custom-schedule.html file for an example of
    how one of these schedule tables is constructed.
    {% endcomment %}

{% comment %}
SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
and end easier to find.

This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.
{% endcomment %}

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

{% comment %}
For online workshops, the section below provides:
- installation instructions for the Zoom client
- recommendations for setting up Learners' workspace so they can follow along
  the instructions and the videoconferencing

If you do not use Zoom for your online workshop, edit the file
`_includes/install_instructions/videoconferencing.html`
to include the relevant installation instructions.
{% endcomment %}
{% if online != "false" %}

These lectures and hands-on exercises are a part of the training curriculum from
the SfN 2018 training course ran by [ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org)
(Reproducible Neuroimaging) Center.  Selected materials are taylored for
this course and cover only some sections within the full-day, but otherwise really compressed, event schedule.
Please visit [ReproNim: Teach](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) for
more materials, which we will also reference within specific lessons here.


### Introduction

The term "reproducibility" conjures a mental image of dedicated systems
conducting automated and repeatable computations.  However, **you** can
embrace reproducibility as a principle to apply to your day-to-day
research activities.  Neuroimaging is a heavily data and software driven
field of science.  As a result, by learning more tricks and techniques
of the tools that you already use daily, you will discover ways to
not only improve efficiency but also increase the reproducibility of
your research.

To some degree, reproducibility requires knowledge of **what**, **when**,
and **how** any particular analysis was carried out. Therefore the
lessons in this module will focus on helping to answer those questions,
while going from how "black box" shell could provide you valuable record
of your activities, over to use of complete computational environments
where versioning and origin information about each component is either
exactly prescribed or just could be identified, and then to entire (simple
but complete) data analysis from raw data while maintaining a complete
and unambiguous provenance of all actions and access to **all**
components of the study (code, data, computational environments).
