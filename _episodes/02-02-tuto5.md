title: "Tutorial 5: Connectome Spectral Analysis"
teaching: 15
exercises: 45
questions:
- "What is the Fourier spectrum?"
- "What is the Fourier transform?"
- "How do these concepts generalize to graphs, such as the human connectome?"

objectives:
- Get familiar with basic graph signal processing (GSP). 
- Get an intuition on how brain function and structure can be studied with GSP. 
keypoints:
- Oscillations are just Fourier modes of a ring graph.
- Connectome harmonics are just Fourier modes of a connectome graph.
