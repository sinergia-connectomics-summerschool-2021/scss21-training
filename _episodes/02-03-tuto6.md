### Introduction

Computational brain network models have emerged as a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of the human brain. Theoretical models are often applied to study complex non-linear systems, such as the brain, in order to investigate the interplay between known dynamical and structural features. In this tutorial, a relatively simple whole-brain model will be introduced based on a set of coupled oscillators near a Hopf bifurcation.

### Overline
1. We will focus on understanding the key properties of a Hopf oscillator. In particular, we will investigate the role of its bifurcation parameter, which describes if the system presents oscillatory or noisy activity.
2. We will study the behaviour of a network of coupled Hopf oscillators in a simple simulated network. The complexity of the network structure and dynamics will be altered by changing the underlying connectivity matrix and the global coupling parameter.
3. Finally, the previously introduced whole-brain model will be used to fit empirical data of resting state fMRI brain activity. The model parameters will be used to interpret certain aspects of the underlying dynamics.
