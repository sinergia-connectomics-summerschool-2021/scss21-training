title: "Tutorial 6: Computational modelling"
teaching: 15
exercises: 45
questions:
- "What is a Stuart-Landau oscillator (Hopf oscillator)?"
- "How can a model based on coupled oscillators simulate the dynamics of a simple network?"
- "How can such a model be used to characterize certain dynamical aspects of brain activity?"
objectives:
1.Generating local dynamics: single-node oscillator
- Visualize and describe the dynamics of a single-node oscillating system near a Hopf bifurcation.
- Change the regime (bifurcation parameter) of the oscillator to generate different local dynamics.
2. From local to global: network of coupled oscillators
- Understand how different oscillators can be linked to obtain a network of coupled oscillators and simulate data.
- Characterize changes in certain aspects of network dynamics as a function of different model parameters (coupling parameter, connectome).

3.Using a model of coupled oscillators to characterize brain dynamics
- Understand the role of the model parameters to constrain the model with real data.
- Fit the model with empirical resting-state human fMRI data and characterize certain aspects of brain activity.
- Understand the use, applicability and limitations of whole-brain models.
