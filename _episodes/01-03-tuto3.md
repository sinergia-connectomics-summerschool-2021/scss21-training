title: "Tutorial 3: \"ESI: Scalp to sources\""
teaching: 45
exercises: 15
start: true
questions:
- "What are the steps to implement Electric Source Imaging?"
- "How can I implement it with Fieldtrip?"
objectives:
- "To learn how to preprocess EEG evoked potentials"
- "To learn how to create the headmodel and sourcemodel from subject-specific MRI"
- "To learn how to estimate the forward and inverse model for ESI"
- "To learn how to reconstruct ROI-timecourses from source-timecourses"

keypoints:
- The functional signal (EEG) needs to be artefact-free for ESI to be accurate
- The source points are distributed in the grey matter, which needs to be coregistered with the MRI used to calculate the headmodel
- The solution of inverse problem is ill-posed so no solution is optimal
- Source timecourses need to be summarised in ROI-timecourses
