### Introduction

###  What is BIDS? from [http://www.repronim.org/module-FAIR-data/01-Web-of-Data/](http://www.repronim.org/module-FAIR-data/01-Web-of-Data/)

[Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (BIDS) is a community developed file organization and naming scheme ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS)) that makes it easier to publish data and share it with others in a consistent format. BIDS is being developed within the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](http://incf.org) and in the collaboration with many scientists working in the neuroimaging field. The goal of BIDS is to define a powerful, flexible, and consistent framework for integrating the diverse types of experimental data routinely acquired in neuroimaging studies. Provisions are included in BIDS to accommodate these data types: subject-level variables (e.g. gender, age, handedness); longitudinal and multi-session studies; structural, anatomical imaging data; resting state and task-based fMRI data; task event information; diffusion-weighted imaging data; field maps for correcting for B0 inhomogeneity; physiological monitoring output acquired during MRI experiments; behavioral data collected without MRI; and standardized metadata to describe the conditions and parameters of the experiment data.

<!-- BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) is a standard for the organization and description of neuroimaging and corresponding behavioral data, which has been largely lacking within the neuroimaging community. More specifically, data that come off the scanner are converted to NIFTI and JSON files, organized into a specific directory schema, and labeled following a precise naming convention. The result is an organized dataset that can be easily shared and understood by other researchers. -->

Originaly developed for MRI, Extended to EEG...

Success reason:
* Right moment when researchers
* Not a database
* Flexibity and evolution design principles

###  Why BIDS? adapted from [Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenScience/OS/BIDS_Overview.html)

1. Reproducibility and Data Sharing: One of the more common issues that can arise for imaging researchers is receiving data from a colleague and not being able to make heads or tails of it: how the data are named and organized do not make intuitive sense to you, finding pertinent information (e.g. Repetition Time) is time-consuming, etc. What transpires is time wasted trying to make sense of the data, leading to needless back and forth with colleague(s). Thanks to the BIDS specifications, the hassles of data sharing are largely alleviated. By extension, improved data sharing allows researchers to better assess and reproduce others’ experimental findings.

2. Access to [“BIDS-apps”](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/): Once converted to BIDS, data can be applied to software packages that take BIDS datasets as their input, colloquially referred to as “BIDS-apps”. Two of the most common and used apps are MRIQC (a quality control pipeline that generates metrics of your data), and fMRIPrep (a standarized pre-processing pipeline). Having access to fMRIPrep is incredibly useful, as labs (and even individuals within a single lab) typically have their own idiosyncratic pre-processing pipelines, which can influence findings in subsequent analyses, and create confusion for others when attempting to re-process the data. By having a standarized pipeline such as fMRIPrep, which incorporates different sofware packages (such as FSL, AFNI, ANTs, FreeSurfer, and nipype), datasets across labs/institutions can be pre-processed in a highly reproducible and transparent manner.

3. Share your own BIDS-app(s): It is not uncommon for researchers to develop a novel analysis tool or technique that languishes on their Github or some other repository, unable to gain exposure in the neuroimaging community. As BIDS becomes increasingly popular however, dataset organization and pre-processing is becoming more standardized, which can be used by various BIDS-apps. By developing a tool that can handle BIDS data, you have created a BIDS-app that is potentially applicable to a large range of users.

###  Getting familiar with BIDS and the summer school dataset

> ## Exercise: Create a BIDS-compliant dataset (click on the arrow to the right to open)
>
> In this exercise you will work through the creation of a BIDS dataset using sample data originally obtained from the [VEPCON dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003505/versions/1.0.2).  Please follow the following steps:
>
> 1. Download the [sample base dataset]({{site.root}}/data/ds000030_single_subj_base.zip) This sample data has been modified from the original OpenFMRI distribution for use in this exercise.
> 2. Working with the BIDS material provided (above) and information from the [data publication in Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016110) and re-work the base dataset to conform to BIDS.
> 3. As you work through this exercise - you can use the [BIDS validator](http://incf.github.io/bids-validator/) to check your progress (must use Google Chrome or Firefox).

###  How can I convert to BIDS?

For MRI data, you will need to have access to your or others’ raw data (e.g. dicoms) in order to perform the conversion. There are several different packages that can be used to accomplish this, such as [dcm2bids](https://github.com/UNFmontreal/Dcm2Bids), [heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv)/[reproin](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin), [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin), [bidskit](https://github.com/jmtyszka/bidskit).

For EEG data, you will need to have access to the raw EEG files in order to perform the conversion. There are several different packages that have been developed to support this process, such as [mne-bids](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids), [Fieldtrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) [data2bids](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/reference/data2bids/), [bids-matlab-tools EEGLab addon](https://github.com/sccn/bids-matlab-tools), [BrainVision bv2bids](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/bv2bids/).

For physiological data, there exist [physio2bids](https://github.com/tarrlab/physio2bids) and [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin) for data recorded with Siemens MRI scanner, and [phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids) for data recorded by AcqKnowledge (BIOPAC) and Labchart (ADInstruments).

Admittingly, most BIDS converters require a bit of user input and work. A number of great tutorials are available online to help you getting started.
