###  What is BIDS?

[Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (BIDS) is a community developed file organization and naming scheme ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS)) that makes it easier to publish data and share it with others in a consistent format. In contrast to alternative solutions that consists more of database systems  harder to manipulate with data and (2) data completely dependent on the database, BIDS is just a collection of files structured in folders accordingly to the specifications. BIDS is being developed within the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility](http://incf.org) and in the collaboration with many scientists working in the neuroimaging field. The goal of BIDS is to define a powerful, flexible, and consistent framework for integrating the diverse types of experimental data routinely acquired in neuroimaging studies.

is intentionally based on simple file formats and folder structures to reflect current lab practices and make it accessible to a wide range of scientists coming from different backgrounds

Provisions are included in BIDS to accommodate these data types: subject-level variables (e.g. gender, age, handedness); longitudinal and multi-session studies; structural, anatomical imaging data; resting state and task-based fMRI data; task event information; diffusion-weighted imaging data; field maps for correcting for B0 inhomogeneity; physiological monitoring output acquired during MRI experiments; behavioral data collected without MRI; and standardized metadata to describe the conditions and parameters of the experiment data.

<!-- BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) is a standard for the organization and description of neuroimaging and corresponding behavioral data, which has been largely lacking within the neuroimaging community. More specifically, data that come off the scanner are converted to NIFTI and JSON files, organized into a specific directory schema, and labeled following a precise naming convention. The result is an organized dataset that can be easily shared and understood by other researchers. -->

###  Why BIDS? 
1. Reproducibility and Data Sharing: One of the more common issues that can arise for imaging researchers is receiving data from a colleague and not being able to make heads or tails of it: how the data are named and organized do not make intuitive sense to you, finding pertinent information (e.g. Repetition Time) is time-consuming, etc. What transpires is time wasted trying to make sense of the data, leading to needless back and forth with colleague(s). Thanks to the BIDS specifications, the hassles of data sharing are largely alleviated. By extension, improved data sharing allows researchers to better assess and reproduce others’ experimental findings.

2. Support tools for validation and manipulation. 

3. Access to [“BIDS-apps”](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/): Once converted to BIDS, data can be applied to software packages that take BIDS datasets as their input, colloquially referred to as “BIDS-apps”. Two of the most common and used apps are MRIQC (a quality control pipeline that generates metrics of your data), and fMRIPrep (a standarized pre-processing pipeline). Having access to fMRIPrep is incredibly useful, as labs (and even individuals within a single lab) typically have their own idiosyncratic pre-processing pipelines, which can influence findings in subsequent analyses, and create confusion for others when attempting to re-process the data. By having a standarized pipeline such as fMRIPrep, which incorporates different sofware packages (such as FSL, AFNI, ANTs, FreeSurfer, and nipype), datasets across labs/institutions can be pre-processed in a highly reproducible and transparent manner.

4. Share your own BIDS-app(s): It is not uncommon for researchers to develop a novel analysis tool or technique that languishes on their Github or some other repository, unable to gain exposure in the neuroimaging community. As BIDS becomes increasingly popular however, dataset organization and pre-processing is becoming more standardized, which can be used by various BIDS-apps. By developing a tool that can handle BIDS data, you have created a BIDS-app that is potentially applicable to a large range of users.

###  How BIDS is different from the existing solutions

*   It comes at a the time researchers are more and more incentivized to share their data

*   Existing solutions are more online databases that make (1) harder to manipulate with data and (2) data completely dependent on the database, while BIDS is just a collection of files structured in folders accordingly to the specifications.

*   Focus on interoperability, simplicity, public data sharing, community, and extensibility.

###  Getting familiar with BIDS and the summer school dataset

The dataset that will be used in this tutorial and throughout most of the tutorials of the summer school consists of a sample of the [VEPCON dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003505/versions/1.0.2), a multimodal neuroimaging dataset created by our consortium. It follows the BIDS standard and provides raw data of high-density EEG, structural MRI and diffusion weighted images (DWI) recorded in the first of the 20 participants. Visual evoked potentials were recorded while the participant discriminated briefly presented faces from scrambled faces, or coherently moving stimuli from incoherent ones.

###  How can I convert to BIDS?

For MRI, you will need to have access to raw data (e.g. dicoms) in order to perform the conversion. There are several different packages that can be used to accomplish this, such as [dcm2bids](https://github.com/UNFmontreal/Dcm2Bids), [heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv)/[reproin](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin), [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin), [bidskit](https://github.com/jmtyszka/bidskit).

For EEG, you will need to have access to raw data in order to perform the conversion. There are several different packages that supports this process, such as [mne-bids](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids), [Fieldtrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) [data2bids](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/reference/data2bids/), [bids-matlab-tools EEGLab addon](https://github.com/sccn/bids-matlab-tools), [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm), [BrainVision bv2bids](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/bv2bids/).

For physiological recordings, there exist [physio2bids](https://github.com/tarrlab/physio2bids) and [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin) for data recorded with Siemens MRI scanner, and [phys2bids](https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids) for data recorded by AcqKnowledge (BIOPAC) and Labchart (ADInstruments).

Admittingly, most BIDS converters require a bit of user input and work. A number of great tutorials are available online to help you getting started.
