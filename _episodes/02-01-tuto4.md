title: "Tutorial 4: Dynamic Functional Connectivity"
teaching: 40
exercises: 20
questions:
- What is Dynamic Functional Connectivity?
- How can we model EEG time-series to estimate dynamic functional connectivity?
- Which are the main parameters we need?
objectives:
- Modeling EEG signals as multivariate, multi-trial time series.
