teaching: 40
exercises: 20
questions:
- What is Dynamic Functional Connectivity?
- How can we model EEG time-series to estimate dynamic functional connectivity?
- Which are the main parameters we need?
objectives:
- Modeling EEG signals as multivariate, multi-trial time series.
- Estimation of effective connectivity through Self-tuning Optimized Kalman (STOK) filter
- Add structural connectivity as prior information before estimating the effective connectivity

keypoints:
- Dynamic Functional Connectivity takes into account that EEG is a nonstationary signal (i.e., signal statistical characteristics change with time)
- The proposed algorithms (STOK and siSTOK) to estimate Dynamic Functional Connectivity are powerful tools to integrate to effective connectivity brain structural information as a prior
